# CODOC Project Workflow

## Workflow of CODOC

The workflow of CODOC can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**
    - Gather code repositories from specified sources (e.g., GitHub, local files).
    - Filter relevant programming languages and project types.
    - Store code files in a structured format for further processing.

2. **Code Parsing**
    - Use language-specific parsers to analyze the code structure.
    - Extract:
        - Functions, classes, and methods
        - Variables and constants
        - Dependencies and imports
    - Generate abstract syntax trees (ASTs) for deeper analysis.

3. **Feature Extraction**
    - Analyze code to extract features relevant for documentation:
        - Function signatures and docstrings
        - Comments and inline explanations
        - Code complexity metrics
        - Dependencies and interconnections
    - Store these features in a structured format for processing.

4. **Documentation Generation**
    - Convert extracted features into human-readable documentation.
    - Include:
        - Function/method descriptions
        - Input/output explanations
        - Examples of usage
        - Dependency diagrams (if applicable)
    - Optionally, integrate automatic summarization for large codebases.

5. **Evaluation & Refinement**
    - Review generated documentation for accuracy and clarity.
    - Apply feedback and adjust parsing or extraction methods.
    - Iterate over the process to improve coverage and quality.

6. **Integration**
    - Make documentation accessible via:
        - Web interfaces or dashboards
        - Exported markdown or PDF files
        - APIs for automated access
    - Ensure the documentation is easy to navigate and maintain.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript (or specify)
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** `ast`, `re`, `NLTK`/`spaCy` (if NLP used), `Graphviz` (for dependency diagrams)
- **Optional AI Models:** LLMs for summarizing or explaining code
